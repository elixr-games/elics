## [2.3.0] - "Streamliner" - May 29, 2025

A focused release that streamlines the component API by removing lifecycle hooks in favor of a more flexible query subscription system.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed component lifecycle hooks**: The `onAttach` and `onDetach` callbacks have been removed from the component API. Components are now pure data containers without built-in lifecycle management.
- **Migration required**: Applications using `onAttach`/`onDetach` must migrate to query subscriptions:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const Component = createComponent(schema, onAttach, onDetach);

  // After
  const Component = createComponent(schema);
  const query = world.queryManager.registerQuery({ required: [Component] });
  query.subscribe('qualify', onAttach);
  query.subscribe('disqualify', onDetach);
  ```

### Added

- **Query subscription for lifecycle tracking**: Use `query.subscribe('qualify'/'disqualify')` to track when components are added or removed from entities
- **Multiple lifecycle listeners**: The new system supports multiple subscribers for the same component events
- **Conditional lifecycle tracking**: Create queries that track combinations of components, not just individual ones

### Fixed

- Fixed missing `disqualify` callbacks when removing the last component from an entity

### Changed

- Simplified component API - components are now pure data structures
- Improved separation of concerns - lifecycle logic is decoupled from component definitions
- Enhanced flexibility - subscriptions can be dynamically added or removed at runtime

### Documentation

- Updated component documentation to reflect the removal of lifecycle hooks
- Added comprehensive examples of using query subscriptions for lifecycle tracking
- Enhanced query documentation with component lifecycle tracking patterns
