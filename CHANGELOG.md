## [3.0.0] - "Adapter" - July 24, 2025

A major release focused on framework extensibility and external tool integration, introducing component metadata, registry system, and entity lifecycle customization.

### Added

- **Component Metadata System**: Components now require an `id` parameter and support optional `description` for better tooling integration
- **ComponentRegistry**: Global registry for component lookup by ID, enabling powerful external tool integration
- **Entity Release Callbacks**: Optional `entityReleaseCallback` in WorldOptions for custom cleanup logic when entities are destroyed
- **External Tool Integration**: Support for Unity, Blender, and custom editor integration through component metadata
- **Build-time Component Discovery**: Documentation for AST parsing approach to extract component definitions at build time

### Breaking Changes

- **createComponent Signature**: Now requires an `id` parameter as the first argument:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const Component = createComponent(schema);

  // After
  const Component = createComponent(
  	'ComponentId',
  	schema,
  	'Optional description',
  );
  ```

- **Component Interface**: All Component objects now include `id` and optional `description` fields
- **Automatic Component Registration**: Components are automatically recorded in ComponentRegistry when created

### Enhanced Features

- **Lazy Component Registration**: Components are automatically registered with World when first used with entities or queries
- **Improved TypeScript Support**: Enhanced typing for component metadata and registry operations
- **Framework Integration**: Better support for framework-level extensions and custom ECS implementations

### API Changes

- **ComponentRegistry Methods**: New static methods for component lookup and management:
  - `ComponentRegistry.record()` - Records components (called automatically)
  - `ComponentRegistry.getById()` - Retrieves components by ID
  - `ComponentRegistry.has()` - Checks component existence
  - `ComponentRegistry.getAllComponents()` - Lists all components
  - `ComponentRegistry.clear()` - Clears registry (testing only)

### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Component Registry Documentation**: Added detailed examples for external tool integration
- **Entity Lifecycle Documentation**: Added entityReleaseCallback usage examples and patterns
- **Build Tool Integration Guide**: Documentation for AST parsing and webpack/vite plugin development
- **Updated Getting Started Guide**: Revised all examples to use new createComponent signature

### Internal Improvements

- **Error Handling**: ComponentRegistry throws errors for duplicate component IDs instead of warnings
- **Release Workflow**: Simplified GitHub Actions workflow to only trigger from web interface
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for all new features and breaking changes

### Migration Guide

To upgrade from v2.x to v3.0.0:

1. **Update createComponent calls** - Add unique ID as first parameter
2. **Optional: Use ComponentRegistry** - Leverage new lookup capabilities for tooling
3. **Optional: Add entityReleaseCallback** - Implement custom cleanup if needed

This release maintains full ECS performance while significantly expanding integration capabilities for complex applications and external tooling.

## [2.4.0] - "Enumerator" - July 11, 2025

A significant feature release that adds comprehensive enum support for type-safe component properties with automatic storage optimization.

### Added

- **Enum Type Support**: New `Types.Enum` for defining enumerated component properties with numeric constants
- **Automatic Storage Optimization**: Smart selection between Int8Array and Int16Array based on enum value ranges
- **Runtime Validation**: Validates enum values during setValue operations and component initialization when checks are enabled
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript support with proper type inference for enum properties
- **Schema Validation**: Validates that enum fields include required `enum` property during component registration

### Performance Improvements

- **Switch Statement Optimization**: Converted if/else chains to switch statements for better performance in component and entity operations
- **Conditional Validation**: Enum validation logic only executes when `CHECKS_ON` is true, improving runtime performance
- **Early Validation**: Enum property existence is validated once during component initialization rather than on every operation

### Breaking Changes

- **Schema Interface**: `TypedSchema` now supports conditional field types - enum fields require an additional `enum` property

### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Enum Documentation**: Added detailed enum usage examples and API documentation
- **Updated Getting Started Guide**: Enhanced with enum examples showing type-safe state management
- **Component Documentation**: Added enum examples demonstrating storage optimization and validation

### Internal Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Added specific error message for invalid enum values
- **Validation Functions**: New `assertValidEnumValue` function for consistent enum validation
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript definitions for enum schema fields

## [2.3.0] - "Streamliner" - May 29, 2025

A focused release that streamlines the component API by removing lifecycle hooks in favor of a more flexible query subscription system.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed component lifecycle hooks**: The `onAttach` and `onDetach` callbacks have been removed from the component API. Components are now pure data containers without built-in lifecycle management.
- **Migration required**: Applications using `onAttach`/`onDetach` must migrate to query subscriptions:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const Component = createComponent(schema, onAttach, onDetach);

  // After
  const Component = createComponent(schema);
  const query = world.queryManager.registerQuery({ required: [Component] });
  query.subscribe('qualify', onAttach);
  query.subscribe('disqualify', onDetach);
  ```

### Added

- **Query subscription for lifecycle tracking**: Use `query.subscribe('qualify'/'disqualify')` to track when components are added or removed from entities
- **Multiple lifecycle listeners**: The new system supports multiple subscribers for the same component events
- **Conditional lifecycle tracking**: Create queries that track combinations of components, not just individual ones

### Fixed

- Fixed missing `disqualify` callbacks when removing the last component from an entity

### Changed

- Simplified component API - components are now pure data structures
- Improved separation of concerns - lifecycle logic is decoupled from component definitions
- Enhanced flexibility - subscriptions can be dynamically added or removed at runtime

### Documentation

- Updated component documentation to reflect the removal of lifecycle hooks
- Added comprehensive examples of using query subscriptions for lifecycle tracking
- Enhanced query documentation with component lifecycle tracking patterns
