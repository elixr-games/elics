# Architecture Overview

ECS (Entity Component System) is a design pattern widely used in game development and complex application design, characterized by its flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. EliCS is an implementation of this pattern, offering a streamlined approach to managing entities, components, systems, and queries.

## Core Concepts

### [Entities](entity.md)

Entities are fundamental objects or actors within your application. They are essentially containers for components and do not possess any direct functionality or data.

### [Components](component.md)

Components are pure data containers that define the properties or behaviors of entities. They are modular and can be dynamically attached to or detached from entities.

### [Systems](system.md)

Systems contain the logic of your application. They operate on entities that have specific component configurations, defined through queries.

### [Queries](query.md)

Queries are used by systems to efficiently select entities based on their components. EliCS utilizes a bitmasking technique for fast query evaluation.

### [World](world.md)

The World is the central orchestrator in EliCS. It manages the lifecycle and interaction of entities, components, systems, and queries.

## Example: Building a Game

Imagine we are building a game where players fight against robots and drones. The following example demonstrates the complete workflowâ€”from defining components and creating entities, to developing systems and integrating everything within the World.

1. **Defining Components**:  
   Components store data that describes specific characteristics of an entity. For our game, we might define:

   - **GroundMover**: Indicates the entity can move on the ground.
   - **AirMover**: Indicates the entity can move through the air.
   - **Enemy**: Identifies the entity as an enemy.
   - **Object3D**: Contains the Object3D data for rendering.

2. **Creating Entities**:  
   Entities are objects in the game world, defined by the components they possess. For our game:

   - **Robot**: Has the `GroundMover`, `Enemy`, and `Object3D` components.
   - **Drone**: Has the `AirMover`, `Enemy`, and `Object3D` components.
   - **Player**: Has the `GroundMover` and `Object3D` components.

3. **Defining Systems**:  
   Systems implement the logic that acts on entities with specific components. In our example:

   - **GroundMovement System**: Moves all entities with a `GroundMover` component (e.g., Player, Robot).
   - **AirMovement System**: Moves all entities with an `AirMover` component (e.g., Drone).
   - **Chase System**: Makes entities that are both `Enemy` and `GroundMover` (e.g., Robot) chase the player.
   - **Attack System**: Manages interactions between `Enemy` and `Player` entities.

4. **World Integration and Execution Cycle**:  
   Register components and systems with the World. This step initiates the execution cycle:
   - The World creates entities, attaches components, and registers systems.
   - The execution cycle begins as the World updates all systems in each frame or tick, processing entity interactions and game logic.
